# CSC270--Data-Structures
## Jared Rand

All the projects we made in Data Structures. The professor provided the skeleton of the program and the test file, and we filled in most of the functions to make them work correctly.

The Projects:

 1. Student Read/Write File
 
 2. Array Based Bag
 
 3. Linked Bag
 
 4. Circular Array Based Deque
 
 5. Sorting Algorithms
